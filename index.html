              <li>By consisting of a team of 4 members, we examined 7+ subtitles-generating platforms and figured out
                the most feasible method.</li>
              <li>After discovering all the platforms, we all decided on veed.io as this software takes the audio from
                any video file and then generates text and timecodes. Anyone can look through the auto-captioned text
                and make edits in the editors, and you can choose from a bunch of text styles.</li>
              <li>After inspection of all the prospects we decided to attach the link to google translator on the
                website which will copy the generated text from veed.io to a translator and convert it and then retrieve
                those text and display it while playing any video.</li>
              <li>We created a website which our client was looking for, but it was consuming lots of time to render the
                text and the translation, and it was frustrating to wait for all that to happen. So, we asked our
                mentors they helped us and took the lead in developing this website finally, we did all those procedures
                in under 60 sec.</li>
